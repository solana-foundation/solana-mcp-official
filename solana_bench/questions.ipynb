Which builder turns on the built-in precompiles list, and how does it decide which ones to activate?\", \"answer\": \"Use `.with_precompiles()`.

Which helper function creates the buffer account and writes the program in 512-byte chunks before deployment?\", \"answer\": \"`litesvm_loader::deploy_upgradeable_program` internally calls the private `load_upgradeable_buffer` helper, which writes the program in 512-byte slices defined by `CHUNK_SIZE`.\", \"mcp_tool\": \"Solana_Documentation_Search\"},\n",

        "    {\"question\": \"You are building a Solana program using Pinocchio and you need advanced string formatting but want to keep compute usage as low as possible. What is the recommended solution?\", \"answer\": \"Use the `pinocchio-log` crate’s `log!` macro. It provides a custom, lightweight formatting system that supports basic string and numeric formatting at a lower compute cost than Rust’s built-in `format_args!`.\", \"mcp_tool\": \"Solana_Documentation_Search\"},\n",
        "    {\"question\": \"What happens when you attempt to decode an account that does not exist on-chain using `fetchEncodedAccount` from `@solana/kit`?\", \"answer\": \"The function returns a `MaybeEncodedAccount` with its `exists` field set to `false`, and only the address is known.

If you want to define a Solana program entrypoint that does not parse the full input right away (to save compute units until you actually need to parse), which macro should you use and why?\", \"answer\": \"You should use the `lazy_program_entrypoint!` macro, because it only wraps the raw program input into an `InstructionContext` and defers parsing of accounts and instruction data until those values are explicitly requested.\", \"mcp_tool\": \"Solana_Documentation_Search\"},\n",

In Kit, what *object* must you create first, and what two methods does that object expose?\", \"answer\": \"Create a **Codec** for the struct (e.g. via `getStructCodec([...])`).

How does enabling the `std` feature in `pinocchio` affect the behavior of the `msg!` macro compared to a `no_std` setup?\", \"answer\": \"Enabling the `std` feature allows `msg!` to perform Rust’s built-in string formatting (e.g., `msg!(\\\"Hello {}\\\", var)`). In a `no_std` environment, formatting is not supported by `msg!`, so it can only output literal messages or fixed data.\", \"mcp_tool\": \"Solana_Documentation_Search\"},\n",

Give one practical example from the docs that illustrates how this influences API shape compared with Web3.js.\", \"answer\": \"Kit has no `Connection` class; instead you import individual functions like `createSolanaRpc`.  Because there’s no monolithic class, unused RPC methods do not appear in your bundle, unlike Web3.js where importing `Connection` pulls in every method.\", \"mcp_tool\": \"Solana_Documentation_Search\"},\n",

You have an address that **must** appear as a signer inside an instruction but you don’t have its private key (a wallet extension will sign later).

        "    {\"question\": \"Why is it safe to call `getCreateAssociatedTokenIdempotentInstruction()` every time you mint or transfer tokens with Gill, and what on-chain behavior guarantees idempotency?\", \"answer\": \"Because the instruction was designed to *gracefully fail* (i.e., no-op) when the ATA already exists; the Solana runtime treats the associated-address PDA as a deterministic account, so attempting to re-create it simply returns an error that doesn’t revert the whole transaction.\", \"mcp_tool\": \"Solana_Documentation_Search\"},\n",
        "    {\"question\": \"In `@solana/kit`: Why does `@solana/kit` not return a transaction signature directly from a `sendAndConfirmTransaction` call?\", \"answer\": \"Because the signature is deterministically known beforehand (the fee payer’s signature), so `@solana/kit` provides `getSignatureFromTransaction` to retrieve it.

A *number codec* (e.g. `getU32Codec()`) — length prefix of that type is written before the items.  2. A *fixed numeric literal* — exactly that many items are encoded, no prefix.  3.

What two conditions cause it to insert rather than replace, and which helper detects an existing limit instruction?\", \"answer\": \"It inserts when no existing instruction for compute-unit limit is found **or** `computeUnitLimitReset` is `false`.

How does `pinocchio` convert the raw byte array from the runtime into the separate `program_id`, `accounts`, and `instruction_data` slices when using `entrypoint!`?\", \"answer\": \"It uses zero-copy deserialization.
