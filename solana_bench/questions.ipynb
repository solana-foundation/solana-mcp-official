    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library. If you want to define a Solana program entrypoint that does not parse the full input right away (to save compute units until you actually need to parse), which macro should you use and why?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"You should use the `lazy_program_entrypoint!` macro, because it only wraps the raw program input into an `InstructionContext` and defers parsing of accounts and instruction data until those values are explicitly requested.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library. How does enabling the `std` feature in `pinocchio` affect the behavior of the `msg!` macro compared to a `no_std` setup?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"Enabling the `std` feature allows `msg!` to perform Rust’s built-in string formatting (e.g., `msg!(\\\"Hello {}\\\", var)`). In a `no_std` environment, formatting is not supported by `msg!`, so it can only output literal messages or fixed data.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library. What primary advantage does the `pinocchio-log` crate’s `log!` macro offer over the default Rust formatting (e.g. `format_args!`) when you need to log numeric values?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"It significantly reduces compute units consumption because it uses a lightweight custom formatting routine, whereas Rust’s default `format_args!` is relatively more CPU-intensive for BPF-constrained environments.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library. Why might you choose to include `no_allocator!()` in your entrypoint, and what will happen if your code attempts to allocate memory afterward?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"You would choose `no_allocator!()` to ensure the program never performs heap allocations (reducing overhead and avoiding surprises). If your code attempts any allocation, the program will panic immediately because the global allocator is set to fail.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library. How does `pinocchio` convert the raw byte array from the runtime into the separate `program_id`, `accounts`, and `instruction_data` slices when using `entrypoint!`?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"It uses zero-copy deserialization. The SVM loader provides a serialized byte array, and `pinocchio` reads that directly into `program_id` (as a `Pubkey`), `accounts` (as slices of `AccountInfo`), and the remainder as `instruction_data`, without extra allocations.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library and the `pinocchio-log` crate. What happens if your log message exceeds the fixed buffer size of `Logger`?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"Any characters beyond the capacity of the `Logger`’s buffer are discarded. The logger simply stops adding more data once it reaches its fixed size.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using the Pinocchio library and want to display a base integer (lamports) as if it has nine decimal places (one SOL). Which formatting option should you use in `pinocchio-log` to reflect this accurately?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"Use the `Precision` attribute (e.g. `\\\"{:.9}\\\"`) for the integer value so that it is formatted as if it has nine decimal digits. For example, `1_000_000_000` would appear as `1.000000000` if you choose `precision=9`.\"\n",

    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using Pinocchio. In what way does `pinocchio::entrypoint!` typically consume fewer compute units than the standard `solana-program` entrypoint macro?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"`pinocchio::entrypoint!` avoids additional copies or allocations by processing the input in a zero-copy manner, leading to lower compute unit usage compared to the generic approach in `solana-program`.\"\n",

    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using Pinocchio and want to keep dependencies minimal. Is it advisable to mix `solana-program` references with `pinocchio`, and why or why not?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"It’s generally not advisable if your goal is to stay dependency-free. `pinocchio` is specifically designed to replace `solana-program`, so mixing them can reintroduce the dependency complexity you wanted to avoid.\"\n",

    "{\n",
    "\"questions\": \"You are building a Solana program using Pinocchio and you need advanced string formatting but want to keep compute usage as low as possible. What is the recommended solution?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"Use the `pinocchio-log` crate’s `log!` macro. It provides a custom, lightweight formatting system that supports basic string and numeric formatting at a lower compute cost than Rust’s built-in `format_args!`.\"\n",

    "\"question\": \"In the context of using the `@solana/kit` JavaScript SDK, if a developer forgets to add a fee payer to a transaction message before signing it, what TypeScript error might they see, and why?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"They would see a type error that the 'Property feePayer is missing in type.' This is because Kit’s `signTransaction` function requires a transaction message that has both a fee payer and a lifetime constraint set. The TypeScript types enforce that you cannot sign an incomplete transaction message.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"In `@solana/kit`, how are addresses handled differently compared to web3.js 1.x, and why is there not a `PublicKey` class?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"Addresses are plain strings typed as `Address`, and the `PublicKey` class is removed. This improves tree-shakability and reduces bundle size in Kit.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"When using `@solana/kit` in environments without native Web Crypto Ed25519 support, what should a developer do to ensure signing still works?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"They should install and call `install()` from `@solana/webcrypto-ed25519-polyfill`, which mimics the Ed25519 Web Crypto API functionality in unsupported environments.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"Why is the `pipe` utility from `@solana/functional` helpful when constructing transaction messages using `@solana/kit`?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"`pipe` enables functional composition of transaction message transformations (fee payer, blockhash, instructions) without reassigning intermediate variables.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"How can you estimate and limit compute unit usage for a transaction in `@solana/kit`?\",\n",

    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"In the `@solana/kit` SDK, how does `getMyTokenCodec()` differ from just using `getMyTokenEncoder()` and `getMyTokenDecoder()`?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"`getMyTokenCodec()` combines both encoding and decoding into one reusable codec object, enabling round-trip serialization/deserialization for the `MyToken` structure.\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"When migrating to `@solana/kit`, how can developers convert legacy web3.js `VersionedTransaction` objects?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"Use `fromVersionedTransaction()` from `@solana/compat` to transform the legacy transaction object into a Kit-compatible message for signing or sending.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"question\": \"What is `@solana/kit`, and how does it relate to the older `@solana/web3.js` package?\",\n",
    "\"answer\": \"`@solana/kit` is the modern replacement for `@solana/web3.js` 2.x. The old 1.x version is still available under a legacy package, but all new development happens in `@solana/kit`.\"\n",
